Camagru is a **mini Instagram-like web application** built as part of the 42 school curriculum.  
It allows users to **capture photos via webcam or upload PNG images**, apply fun overlays (frames, bunny ears, etc.), and share them in a public gallery. Logged-in users can **like, comment**, and receive **notifications**.

##  Tech Stack

- **Backend**: PHP 8.2 (Vanilla PHP)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Server**: Apache 2.4 (Dockerized)
- **Mailing**: msmtp + Gmail SMTP (for notifications)
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose

##  Architecture

The project follows a classic **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern:

.
├── controllers/ # Business logic & routing
├── models/ # Database access and queries
├── views/ # HTML/PHP templates for rendering
├── public/ # Public static files (CSS, JS, uploads)
├── config/ # DB connection config
└── docker/ # Apache + MySQL + SSL setup


- **Models** contain functions for interacting with users, images, likes, comments.
- **Controllers** handle routing and logic like login, registration, gallery rendering.
- **Views** include `layout.php` and pages like `edit`, `gallery`, `auth` forms.

### Image Upload Flow
- Webcam: Capture preview → send PNG → merge overlay on server (GD) → save
- Upload: User can upload PNG → server saves validated file
- Images are only stored as .png and validated both client & server side.

### Email Notifications
 - On comment: Author receives an email (unless opted-out in settings)
 - SMTP configured with Gmail using msmtp (password via env variable)
